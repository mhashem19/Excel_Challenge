Brief conclusion:
The Kickstarter data set is clean and organized. This allows the analysis to be done in proper and accurate ways. Based on the data provided the following observations can be made in a very brief manner. This means that we can draw as much conclusion as we want depending the objective and scope of our research:

1.	Given the provided data, the following three main conclusions can be made on Kickstarter data:

Overall, 53.11% of 4115 Kickstarter projects were successful. Among the projects that were successful, entertainment projects have had the highest success rate. Music projects were the most successful with overall 77.14% of successful projects following by film & video with 57.69% successful projects. 
The entertainment projects attracted more funds then other types of projects such as journalism and food. The financial goals also played significant role in either a project failed or succeeded. 71% of the Projects with less than $1000 financial goal were succeeded. While 58% of the projects with more than $50000 financial goal were failed. It indicates a positive correlation between lower project financial goal and level of success, while inverse correlation between higher financial goals and failure. 
Another key factor in project success was the average of the backers for each category of projects. The more successful projects had the more average number of backers. 

2.	There are few limitations associated with Kickstarter’ data table. The very first limitation is the information about the number of people that were involved in the projects. There is almost no demographic information in the data table. This pose an important limitation to the analysis as we don’t know who did what, in order to relate the human factor to the project status. 
Another important limitation is the type and amount of information that the data gives about the backers. We don’t know the character of the backers to draw some key conclusion, as why some projects were not able to set sufficient financial goals. 
3.	There is more space for more tables and graphs that could be created for the Kickstarter data. One could be the amount of times each project took to be completed, whether they were on time or overdue. Another table or graph would be the about the countries that projects implemented in, and their relation to relevant projects’ success and failure.
